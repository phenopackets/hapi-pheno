This repository contains code for working with the 
`GA4GH Phenopacket Schema <https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema>`_ 
in `HL7 FHIR <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/>`_ environments using the 
the `Phenopacket core IG <https://github.com/phenopackets/core-ig>`_. 

The software uses the `HAPI FHIR <https://hapifhir.io/>`_ Java
library to model the classes of the IG and provides methods for 
translating to and from FHIR and native GA4GH phenopackets. 

The source code for HAPI Pheno is available on 
`GitHub <https://github.com/phenopackets/hapi-pheno>`_.
